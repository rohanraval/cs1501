### Career Resources

- [Twitter][twitter_list]
    - Twitter is a great place for learning about what's happening in industry. When they are not busy tweeting about politics, a lot of tech people also like to tweet opinions, analyses, announcements, and even have intellectual debates about develpments in the space. Not only is Twitter a great way to stay updated and immersed in the field, it is also a fantastic opportunity to _interact_ with the community and reach out to others in the space. Many of the people involved in projects (founders, developers, investors, media, enthusiasts, etc) have their DMs open and are receptive if you reach out (and they also sometimes tweet out ways you could get involved with their projects). I really cannot emphasize enough how undervalued Twitter is for professional development in tech. To that end I've curated the above Twitter List of relevant accounts to get you started!
