Below is a list of articles, books, videos, podcasts, and other resources relevant to the [topics](http://rohanraval.com/cs1501/schedule) covered in this course. It is a work-in-progress and is inteded to serve as a library of readings that students can learn from, contribute to, interact with, and, for the purposes of the class, choose to read from for their homeworks. _Please let me know if you come across a good resource so I can add it here!_

## Career Resources
- [Twitter][twitter_list]
    - Twitter is a great place for learning about what's happening in industry. When they are not busy tweeting about politics, a lot of tech people also like to tweet opinions, analyses, announcements, and even have intellectual debates about develpments in the space. Not only is Twitter a great way to stay updated and immersed in the field, it is also a fantastic opportunity to _interact_ with the community and reach out to others in the space. Many of the people involved in projects (founders, developers, investors, media, enthusiasts, etc) have their DMs open and are receptive if you reach out (and they also sometimes tweet out ways you could get involved with their projects). I really cannot emphasize enough how undervalued Twitter is for professional development in tech. To that end I've curated the above Twitter List of relevant accounts to get you started!
