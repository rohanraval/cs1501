Below is a list of articles, books, videos, podcasts, and other resources relevant to the [topics](http://rohanraval.com/cs1501/schedule) covered in this course. It is a work-in-progress and is inteded to serve as a library of readings that students can learn from, contribute to, interact with, and, for the purposes of the class, choose to read from for their homeworks. _Please let me know if you come across a good resource that I've missed!_
