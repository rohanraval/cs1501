Introduces the basic principles of robotics, focusing on core topics in autonomy and artificial intelligence and their applications in self-driving cars, drones, and other types of robots. Students will learn the fundamentals of the autonomy stack and related AI algorithms that allow robots to perform complex tasks like navigating an environment and detecting pedestrians. Topics include: mapping, localization, motion planning and navigation, perception, prediction, motion control, and safety.

# **Course Structure**

- Attendance
    - Lectures will be once a week, 50 mins each. I will try my best to make lectures discussion-based as much as possible to foster engagement.
- Readings
    - There will be a list of short readings each week, from which students should pick one to write a small summary on. These readings will expand on concepts talked about in class that week or connect them with work being done in industry or academia.
- As with any course, you will get out of it what you put into it! The idea behind this course is __not__ to teach you all the theory behind robotics... rather, my goal is to present a sampling of concepts from which you can explore more about the field -- and in doing so, hopefully instill an interest in robotics (possibly as a profession!)
