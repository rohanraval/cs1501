## Organizational Notes

### Housekeeping
- How are the reading responses going?
- Lecture Feedback (again)

### Recap on Sensors
- Talk a little bit more about Cameras vs Lidar
    - What is the big debate in the AV community? Why is this important?
    - Why Elon Musk hates LiDAR... LiDAR as a "crutch"
    - A little bit more about Solid State LiDAR and how it will make it cheaper!
        - Someone asked last time about what is being done to make LiDAR cheaper --> address directly!
- Address question from last time about what range of EM spectrum LiDAR uses
